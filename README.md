This is the CPU I designed in ELEC 5200 Computer Architecture.

It is a Multicycle 16-bit RISC CPU with 16 registers.

You can find the Verilog source and test benches in the src folder. The ISA excel file contains the instruction set, register purposes, and instruction encoding.
I have also included the state table/diagram and a Paint drawing of the datapath.
Program.c is an example C program that I hand-compiled.
